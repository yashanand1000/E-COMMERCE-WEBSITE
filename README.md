# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Available Scripts

For deployment of backend you can directly use npm start in your terminal.
For deployment of frontend first you need to change the directory by using 
## cd frontend

then again use npm start
Now the website can be viewed on the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
